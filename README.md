## Getting Started

This project includes several scripts for development, testing, and code quality. Below is a detailed explanation of each script.

Before running any script, make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

You can execute the scripts using:

```bash
npm run <Script>
npm run dev
```

## Playwright Testing Reports

- Playwright reports are generated if tests are run in headless mode using run-ct-test or run-e2e-test.
- To view Playwright reports:

  - Use view-ct-test-report for Playwright component tests.
  - Use view-e2e-test-report for Playwright end-to-end tests.

- Code Coverage for Playwright Component Tests:
  - Code coverage is configured in playwright-ct-config.ts using Istanbul.
  - The coverage is generated as a JSON summary in .nyc_output (ignored by Git).
  - Convert to an HTML report by running:
    ```bash
    npm run generate-ct-test-coverage-html
    ```
  - The report will be available in the coverage folder (also Git-ignored).

## Git Hooks and Commitlint

### Pre-commit Hook

The pre-commit hook runs commands defined in `.lintstagedrc`.

### Commit Message Guidelines

We use Conventional Commits for structured and meaningful commit messages.

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
[optional body]
[optional footer(s)]
```

### Commitlint Types:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the code meaning (white-space, formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `ci`: Continuous Integration-related changes
- `chore`: Minor changes like updating dependencies
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit

<strong>Breaking Changes:</strong> Add a `!` after the type or scope to signify a breaking change.

#### Examples:

- `feat`: add Playwright testing framework
- `fix`: resolve API response bug
- `docs`: update README.md
- `refactor(api)!`: change API response structure
- `test(component)`: add button component tests

```text
revert: let us never again speak of the noodle incident

## FAQ

### Doesnâ€™t commitlint discourage rapid development and fast iteration?

Commitlint discourages moving fast in a disorganized way. It helps you be able to move fast long term across multiple projects with varied contributors.
