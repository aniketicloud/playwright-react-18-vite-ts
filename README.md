## Getting Started

This project includes several scripts for development, testing, and code quality. Below is a detailed explanation of each script.

Before running any script, make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

You can execute the scripts using:

```bash
npm run <Script>
npm run dev
```

## Playwright Testing Reports

- Playwright reports are generated if tests are run in headless mode using run-ct-test or run-e2e-test.
- To view Playwright reports:

  - Use view-ct-test-report for Playwright component tests.
  - Use view-e2e-test-report for Playwright end-to-end tests.

- Code Coverage for Playwright Component Tests:
  - Code coverage is configured in playwright-ct-config.ts using Istanbul.
  - The coverage is generated as a JSON summary in .nyc_output (ignored by Git).
  - Convert to an HTML report by running:
    ```bash
    npm run generate-ct-test-coverage-html
    ```
  - The report will be available in the coverage folder (also Git-ignored).

<br />

## Vitest Testing Reports

<!-- - Reports are generated if tests are run in the headless mode. These scripts are used to run the tests in headless mode `run-ct-test` and `run-test-e2e`. In this setup generated reports are not opened. Use `view-ct-report` and `view-e2e-report` scripts to open the reports.
- Code coverage for component test will be run. The code is inside playwright-ct-config.ts. Search for istanbul. This code covereage will be of json summary in `.nyc_output` which will be in gitignore. To covert the report to HTML format run `generate-ct-test-coverage-html`. This HTML report will be generated in coverage folder which will be in gitignore.
- pre-commit hook will run commands added in `.lintstagedrc`
- For `commitlint` conventions, use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). The commit message should be structured as follows:

```command
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Conventions of commitlint:

- <type>: add main point of focus. `feat` , `bug`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`, `ci`, `chore`, `style`, `revert`
- [optional scope]: provide additional information. `parser`, `lang`, `api`,
- add ! after `<type>` => `<type>!` or `<type>[optional scope]` =>`<type>[optional scope]!` to draw attention to breaking changes.
- <description>: add the description of the commit. Use present form verb(Use _add_. Do not use _added_) Do not add full stop at the end of the description. after a colon and a white space `: `

### examples of commitlint:

- `feat: Playwright testing framework added`
- `feat(lang): add Hindi language`
- `test(component): add component tests for button component`
- `feat(api)!: add new required parameter while calling the getUsers API`

-

```
chore!: remove support of Node 12
BREAKING CHANGE: http.IncomingMessage 'close' event is not available
```

## FAQ

### Doesnâ€™t commitlint discourage rapid development and fast iteration?

Commitlint discourages moving fast in a disorganized way. It helps you be able to move fast long term across multiple projects with varied contributors.
