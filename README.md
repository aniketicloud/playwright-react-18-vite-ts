## Guide

- Reports are generated if tests are run in the headless mode. These scripts are used to run the tests in headless mode `test-ct` and `test-e2e`. In this setup generated reports are not opened. Use `view-ct-report` and `view-e2e-report` scripts to open the reports.
- Code coverage for component test will be run. The code is inside playwright-ct-config.ts. Search for istanbul. This code covereage will be of json summary in `.nyc_output` which will be in gitignore. To covert the report to HTML format run `generate-ct-test-coverage-html`. This HTML report will be generated in coverage folder which will be in gitignore.
- pre-commit hook will run commands added in `.lintstagedrc`
- For `commitlint` conventions, use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). The commit message should be structured as follows:

```command
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Conventions of commitlint:

- <type>: add main point of focus. `feat` , `bug`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`, `ci`, `chore`, `style`, `revert`
- [optional scope]: provide additional information. `parser`, `lang`, `api`,
- add ! after `<type>` => `<type>!` or `<type>[optional scope]` =>`<type>[optional scope]!` to draw attention to breaking changes.
- <description>: add the description of the commit. Use present form verb(Use _add_. Do not use _added_) Do not add full stop at the end of the description. after a colon and a white space `: `

### examples of commitlint:

- `feat: Playwright testing framework added`
